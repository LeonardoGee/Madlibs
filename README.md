# Madlibs

“Mad Libs” are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in. In the non-computerized version of this game, you ask someone to fill in each of the placeholders without telling them anything about the overall story. Once all placeholders are filled in, you show them the resulting silly story.

The screenshots below indicate a possible flow of the UI for an app that implements this game. It has three screens: a “welcome” screen explaining the app, then a screen that repeatedly prompts the user to fill in placeholders. Once the user has typed in replacements for all these placeholders, the completed story is shown on the screen.
